# Project-ETL-security-Public
In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a secure ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python. The pipeline will involve loading data from a CSV file, transforming it, and loading it into both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. We will also incorporate encryption to secure sensitive data during the process.
